# Background

After completing my high school, I first decided to go for a Bachelor's in computer sciences. There I discovered a real passion for algorithmic and programming. This diploma helped me to understand the main concepts of low-level, high-level and multi-task programming. Owing to this training, I am now at ease to efficiently learn any new programming language or concept.

My favorite scientific programming languages are R and Python. Moreover, I can also program in Matlab and Julia, which I find to be a very promising language.  

# Software(s)

* [OpenAlea - Virtual Plants](http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=openalea) : since the beginning of my PhD, I am using this open source project which is primarily aimed at plant research. More specifically, I am working on the improvement of the *sequence analysis* library which includes an implementation of hidden Semi-Markovian models. The code is mainly written in C++ and is using Python interfaces.
