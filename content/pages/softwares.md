# Computer sciences background

After completing my high school, I first decided to go for a Bachelor's in computer sciences. There I discovered a real passion for algorithmic and programming. This diploma helped me to understand the main concepts of low-level, high-level and multi-task programming. Thanks to that training, I am now at ease to efficiently learn every new programming languages or concepts.

My favorite scientific programming languages are R and Python. Though, I can also deal with Matlab and Julia which, for the last one, I find to be a very promising language.  

# Software(s)

* [OpenAlea - Virtual Plants](http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=openalea) : since the beginning of my PhD, I am using this open source project which primarily aimed at the plant research community. More specifically, I am working on the improvement of the *sequence analysis* library which holds an implementation of hidden Semi-Markovian models. The code is mainly written in C++ and is using Python interfaces.
